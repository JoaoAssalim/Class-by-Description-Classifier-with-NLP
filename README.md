# Text Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of items based on their descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to leverage machine learning classifiers to automatically categorize items into predefined classes, including real estate, machinery, services, information technology, and furniture.

## Introduction

In our daily lives, the task of classifying diverse items into distinct categories is a common challenge that spans various industries. This project addresses this challenge by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text classification. The primary objective is to develop a model capable of accurately categorizing items into predefined classes based on their textual descriptions.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Stores the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Required Python packages can be installed using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoaoAssalim/Class-by-Description-Classifier-with-NLP.git
